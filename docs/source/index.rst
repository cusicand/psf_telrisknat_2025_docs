Welcome to 'PSF TelRiskNat 2025 workshop documentation'
=======================================================
Regional workshop on "Natural hazards in mountains: satellite monitoring and social impacts"

6â€“17 October 2025 Yachay Tech University, San Miguel de Urcuqui, Ecuador

The workshop **Natural hazards in mountain areas: satellite monitoring and social impacts** aims to strengthen the technical and methodological capacities of local actors in the use of advanced optical remote sensing tools for better assessment of natural hazards in mountain areas. The workshop will not only examine threats in mountain environments from a physical perspective, but will also cover the fundamental principles of analysing the vulnerability of populations to natural disasters, giving participants an interdisciplinary view of risk management.
