	abstract = {Intensification of agriculture leads to stress on the environment and subsequently can have strong societal and ecological impacts. In deserts, areas of very high sensitivity to land-use changes, these local-scale impacts are not well documented. On the arid southwestern coast of Peru, several vast irrigation programmes were developed in the 1950s on the flat detritic plateau surrounding narrow valleys to supply new farming areas. We document the long-term effects of irrigation on the erosion of arid deserts in the Vitor and Siguas valleys, south Peru, using 40 yr of satellite data. We demonstrate that irrigation initiated very large slow-moving landslides, affecting one-third of the valleys. Their kinematics present periods of quiescence and short periods of rapid activity, corresponding to landslide destabilization by their headscarp retrogression. This analysis suggests that the landslide motion continues long after their initiation by irrigations. Those landslides affect the fertile valley floors, leading to the destruction of villages and agricultural areas. We conclude that modern intensive farming can strongly impact traditional agriculture in desert areas where water management is particularly critical.},

	abstract = {In mountainous environments, slow-moving landslides (velocities {\textless}100 m/year) are a major concern for local populations. Rainfall is often the dominant forcing, and often result in major changes in kinematics which can mask smaller signals related to internal forcings. We focus here on a major ({\textgreater}40 Mm3) slow-moving landslide in the desert of southern Peru and take advantage of this arid environment to study the internal processes affecting landslide kinematics. We first estimate the ground displacement from time series analysis of Landsat-8 images, spanning a 5.7-year period. Systematic artifacts in the optical time series are shown to correlate with topography, as well as vary seasonally. We apply a novel procedure for correcting these artifacts, which significantly reduces noise in the resulting time series, thereby allowing us to precisely resolve landslide displacements. We find landslide velocities of up to 35 m/year, with complex nonlinear interannual pattern, including a period of rapid acceleration. We validate our optically derived time series using Global Navigation Satellite System field measurements and find uncertainties (root-mean-square error) on the moving mass of 1.12 to 1.55 m. Sudden acceleration of the landslide body after March 2016 may originate from a mass collapse due to retrogression of the headscarp. By coupling sparse 3-D Global Navigation Satellite System measurements with dense 2-D optical time series data, we show that the headscarp retrogression acts like a wedge, resulting in domino-like tilting of the downward blocks, and accelerates basal sliding over 2 years. These observations reveal that the dynamics of this retrogressive landslide are predominantly controlled by sediment supply and that succession of retrogressive and advancing motions is a self-entrainment process.},

  abstract = {Satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has revolutionized remote sensing applications by providing high-resolution and all-weather imaging capabilities. With the increasing availability of SAR data, the need for efficient data processing has become crucial. Onboard processing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges associated with limited downlink capacity and final data products latency. Performing data processing and compression directly on the airborne platform reduces the raw data transmitted to ground stations, which offers several key benefits. First, it significantly reduces the data volume to be downlinked, optimizing the usage of limited bandwidth and minimizing transmission delays. Second, onboard processing enables faster access to processed data products, allowing for quicker decision-making and timely response to dynamic events, enhancing the real-time capabilities of the system that are particularly valuable in time-critical applications. This article discusses various onboard processing techniques employed in SAR systems and explores their challenges, like computational constraints, architectural impacts, power consumption, and algorithm optimization. Furthermore, it examines the potential future developments in onboard processing, such as the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities. The advancements in onboard processing have the potential to revolutionize the way SAR missions are conducted. By leveraging these techniques, SAR systems can achieve improved operational efficiency, reduced data latency, and enhanced real-time capabilities. This article emphasizes the significance of onboard processing in meeting the growing demands of SAR applications and underscores its role in advancing remote sensing capabilities for various sectors, including environmental monitoring, disaster response, and surveillance.},

  abstract = {Rock glaciers are creeping bodies of ice and rock that account for an important part of the mountain cryosphere. In this study, we investigated long-term changes of the Laurichard rock glacier (French Alps), to understand how this rock glacier is responding to climate change. Using feature-tracking and photogrammetric measurements between 1952 and 2019, we quantified changes in thickness, flow velocities and from which we derived the ice/rock flux of the rock glacier at a decadal time scale. This is the first time that emergence velocity and surface mass balance changes have been reconstructed for a rock glacier. Our results reveal a very small surface mass balance ranging from -0.1 m a-1 to +0.05 m a-1, reflecting the role of debris in damping the melt rate of the underlying ice. Surprisingly, we found a more negative surface mass balance in the upper part than in the lower part of the rock glacier during the 1952--1971 cold period, likely due to a reduction in rock and snow mass accumulation. Our study shows that thickness changes are mainly driven by changes in surface mass balance except during the most recent period in the lower part of the rock glacier, which was also influenced by a compressive flow related to a protrusion that prevented the rock glacier from advancing. We conclude that the period 1994--2019 witnessed a marked acceleration in rock glacier flow, in agreement with the observations of other rock glaciers in the European Alps. This strong increase in surface speed is likely a consequence of changes in the basal conditions.},

  abstract = {The western part of Guizhou is located in the second step of East Asia. Although the area is stratigraphically continuous and the surface is dominated by hard limestone and sandstone, catastrophic landslides often occur, seriously threatening residents' lives and the safety of property. Accurate identification of landslides and analysis of their developmental patterns are vital to prevent and reduce the threat of geological disasters. No active landslide survey data cover this region, so this paper identifies the active landslides in the western part of Guizhou by combining surface deformation information, multitemporal optical remote sensing images, geological lithology, and geomorphic features to obtain deformation information from multisource synthetic aperture radar surface data. This process increases the accuracy and reliability of identifying unstable slopes in areas with dense vegetation and steep terrain. By processing 283 Sentinel-1 and PALSAR-2 synthetic aperture radar data, 578 active landslides, 18 of which are high-risk large-scale landslides (landslide groups), are delineated for the first time in a range of 4.64\,{\texttimes}\,104~km2 in the study area. The active landslides mainly include natural landslides, reservoir landslides, and mining-induced landslides, accounting for 2.4\%, 4.2~\%, and 93.4\%, respectively. The spatial distribution of landslides is banded along the cuesta at the edge of an outcrop of coal strata. Landslides are mainly distributed at elevations of 1800--2000~m, with an elevation difference of 50\,{\textasciitilde}\,100~m and a slope range of 35{$^\circ$}\,{\textasciitilde}\,40{$^\circ$}. The landslides are characterized by steep slopes, small scales, mass occurrences, and no dominant slope direction, classifying them as cuesta landslides induced by mining disturbance. Furthermore, nuanced remote sensing interpretation of the disaster elements, such as cuesta cliff, tensile cracks, deep and sizeable tensile channels, isolated rock masses, and collapse debris, and their processes of change, reveals that coal mining-disturbed landslides in this region have experienced four primary stages: natural unloading, mining disturbance, displacement acceleration, and slope failure. This is of great significance for understanding the genetic mechanism and developmental patterns, as well as the risk assessment, of this region.},

  abstract = {The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation is providing unprecedented global coverage, visible to near infrared, atmospherically corrected, 3~m imagery. The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12~month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90\% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2~h and 13~min, 1~h and 30~min, and 1~h and 50~min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6~km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12~month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9\% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non-coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12~months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3~h, and 9.6\%, 71.8\%, and 88.4\% of the land points had average revisit intervals {$<$}24~h, {$<$}36~h, and~{$<~$}48~h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25~s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15~days; 95.4\% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit {$<$}180~s, and 89.1\% had a maximum revisit {$<$}480~h (20~days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as ``standard'' or as ``test'' quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as ``standard'' at each land grid point over the 12~months was 78.14\%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10~day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12~study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10~day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10~day periods respectively. The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December--February) and spring (March--May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12~months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution.},

  abstract = {The large slow-moving landslide of Maca is located in the upper Colca valley (southern Peru), a region characterized by a well pronounced rainy period, and intense and recurrent sustained seismicity. The landslide, developed in deep lacustrine deposits, has recently accelerated, threatening the Maca village. This work aims at understanding the rupture mechanism and the causes of the recent landslide reactivation/acceleration. We present a multidisciplinary characterization of the Maca landslide that includes: (i) geological and morphological mapping in the field; (ii) remote sensing analysis using an historical aerial photograph of 1955 and the Pl{\'e}iades satellite images (2013); (iii) global positioning system (GPS) including time-series of surveys over 13 years, and continuous measurements over 14 months; (iv) a geophysical campaign with deep electrical resistivity tomography profiles acquired across the landslide mass. Our study shows that this 60 Mm3 landslide, which can be classified as a clay/silt compound landslide, moved by 15 m between 2001 and 2014 with a large inter-annual velocity variation (up to a factor of 500) depending on the rainfall intensity. We suggest that these dramatic changes in velocity are the result of the combination of a threshold mechanism and the short intense rainy season in Peru. This study reveals three main driving factors acting at different timescales: (i) over several decades, the river course has significantly changed, causing the Maca landslide reactivation in the 1980s due to the erosion of its toe; (ii) at the year scale, a minimum amount of rainfall is required to trigger the motion and this amount controls the landslide velocity; (iii) transient changes in slide velocity may occur anytime due to earthquakes. This study particularly highlights the non-linear behaviour of the motion with rainfall. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Slow-moving landslides are numerous in mountainous areas and pose a large threat to populations. Many observations show that their kinematics is driven by climatic forcings and earthquakes. In this study, we document the complex interaction between those two forcings on the slow-moving landslide kinematics, based on the retrieval of landslide displacements over 28-years using optical satellite images. To overcome the decorrelation effect over this large time-span, and possible misalignment between images, we develop a method that uses the redundancy of displacement fields from image pairs to derive a robust time-series of displacement. The method is tested on the 28-year long SPOT1/5-Pl{\'e}iades archive, over an area in Peru affected by both earthquakes and rainfall. Errors are estimated on stable areas and by comparison with one 13-year long and eleven 3-year long GPS time-series on the Maca landslide. The methodology diminishes by up to 30\% the uncertainty and reduces significantly the gaps due to decorrelation. The data set allows detecting 3 major landslides, moving at a rate of 35 to 50\,m over 28\,years, and smaller landslides with lower displacement rates. Time-series obtained over the three main landslides provide interesting results of their long-term kinematics, primarily driven by precipitation. We propose simple statistical hydro-kinematic models, relating yearly motion to seasonal rainfall, to explain the observed time-series. We found that annual precipitation is controlling the landslide displacements after a certain rainfall threshold is reached. Besides this control, we show the possible impact of a local Mw 5.4 earthquake in 1991 on the kinematics of the Maca landslide. Our results suggest that the earthquake accelerated the landslide and has an effect during several years on the precipitation threshold required for triggering a motion. These results suggest that the rainfall threshold can vary in time following strong earthquakes shaking.},

  abstract = {Rock glacier velocity is now widely acknowledged as an Essential Climate Variable for permafrost. However, representing decadal regional spatiotemporal velocity patterns remains challenging due to the limited availability of high-resolution (\&lt;5 m) remote sensing data. In contrast, medium-resolution satellite data (10--15 m) covering several decades are globally available but have not been widely used for rock glacier kinematics. This study presents a robust methodological approach combining pairwise feature-tracking image correlation with medium-resolution Landsat 7/Landsat 8 optical imagery, surface displacement time-series inversion and the automatic detection of persistent moving areas (PMAs). Applied to rock glacier monitoring in the semiarid Andes of South America, this methodology enables the detection and quantification of the surface kinematics of 153 rock glaciers, 124 landslides and 105 unclassified landforms over 24 years across a 2250 km2 area. This is the first time that Landsat images have been used to quantify rock glacier displacement time series. The study estimates an average velocity of 0.30{\textpm}0.07 m yr-1 for all PMAs, with rock glaciers moving 23 \% faster (0.37 m yr-1) over the 24-year period. Some large rock glaciers and debris-frozen landforms exhibit surface velocities exceeding 2 m yr-1. The results align well with high-resolution imagery, recent Global Navigation Satellite System measurements and previous inventories. However, the Landsat 7/Landsat 8 (L7/8) imagery-derived velocities are underestimated by approximately 20 \%--30 \% on average. High uncertainties between consecutive image pairs limit the reliability of interpreting annual velocity variations. However, decadal velocity changes exceeding the uncertainties were observed in only 2 \% of PMAs, with two (one) rock glaciers exhibiting significant acceleration (deceleration) over the past two decades. Our calculations show that decadal velocity changes \&lt;0.4 m yr-1 are generally within the uncertainty range when using L7/8 data, with sensitivity depending on the reference period. Despite these limitations, our results highlight the correlation between velocity trends and topographic parameters such as PMA size, orientation, slope and elevation. These relationships suggest that permafrost thaw may influence the occurrence of high-altitude landslides. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using medium-resolution optical satellite imagery for monitoring rock glacier velocity over several decades.},

  abstract = {The prediction of time to slope failure (TSF) is a goal of major importance for both landslide researchers and practitioners. A reasonably accurate prediction of TSF allows human losses to be avoided, damages to property to be reduced and adequate countermeasures to be designed. A pure ``phenomenological'' approach based on the observation and interpretation of the monitored data is generally employed in TSF prediction. Such an approach infers TSF mainly from the ground surface displacements using regression techniques based on empirical functions. These functions neglect the rheological soil parameters in order to reduce the prediction uncertainties. This paper presents an overlook of the methods associated with this approach and proposes a unique expression encompassing most of the previously proposed equations for TSF prediction, thus offering a general framework useful for comparisons between different methods. The methods discussed in this paper provide an effective tool, and sometimes the only tool, for TSF prediction. The fundamental problem is always one of data quality. A full confidence in all assumptions and parameters used in the prediction model is rarely, if ever, achieved. Therefore, TSF prediction models should be applied with care and the results interpreted with caution. Documented case studies represent the most useful source of information to calibrate the TSF prediction models.},

  abstract = {The forecast of a landslide's time of failure and the definition of alert thresholds are fundamental aspects in the study of natural hazards. However, these tasks are particularly difficult due to the large number of parameters and factors involved, and are therefore usually performed with a site-specific approach. This work describes an attempt to generalize the behavior of a landslide approaching collapse, with particular attention to the definition of a general criterion to define alert thresholds. The procedure started with the creation of a database of displacement data recorded for historical landslides, then the inverse velocity model was applied to these datasets to evaluate the time of failure under the assumption of linear behavior during the accelerating phase. A model calibration was conducted to best describe the monitored data and highlight any non-linear trend. A curve describing the velocity versus time relationship was then computed for each single slope failure case using the parameter obtained through this operation. In the final step of the study, these curves were processed with a normalization procedure, thus obtaining a dimensionless velocity-related coefficient. This parameter allowed the comparison of different landslide datasets on a single graph, which can be used as a general reference to define alert thresholds for emergency purposes. In order to test the criterion's ability to represent landslide behavior, the procedure was also applied to a different case by simulating progressive data acquisition.},

  abstract = {Recent studies using satellite data have shown a growing interest in detecting and anticipating landslide failures. However, their value for an actual landslide prediction has shown variable results. Therefore, the use of satellite images for that purpose still requires additional attention. Here, we study the landslide of the Tunnel du Chambon in the French Alps that ruptured in July 2015, generating major impacts on economic activity and infrastructures. To evaluate the contribution of very high-resolution optical satellite images to characterize and potentially anticipate the landslide failure, we conduct here a retro analysis of its evolution. Two time periods are analyzed: September 2012 to September 2014, and May to July 2015. We combine Pl{\'e}iades optical images analysis and geodetic measurements from in situ topographic monitoring. Satellite images were correlated to detect pre-failure motions, showing 1.4-m of displacement between September 2012 and September 2014. In situ geodetic measures were used to analyze motions during the main activity of the landslide in June and July 2015. Topographic measurements highlight different areas of deformations and two periods of strong activity, related to the last stage of the tertiary creep and to anthropic massive purges of unstable masses. The law of acceleration toward the rupture observed in June and July 2015 over the topographic targets also fits well the satellite observation between 2012 and 2014, showing that the landslide probably already entered into tertiary creep 2.5 years before its failure.},
