Surface elevation change between two (or more) DEMs is a standard approach used widely—for example, to estimate glacier mass balance :cite:`dussaillant2019` and to map the geomorphic imprint of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) :cite:`schneider2014`."

Each source has trade‑offs in spatial coverage, resolution, cost, and revisit; nevertheless, stereo‑photogrammetry has become a cornerstone of natural‑hazard research.
