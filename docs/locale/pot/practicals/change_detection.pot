msgid "We are now going to use `Open Street Map (OSM) <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ to check our mapping. OSM data is a geographic database feed by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails. It is therefore possible to download the raw data directly and reuse it as you wish, for cartographic or other purposes. Every week, a complete file called ``planet`` is generated and made available by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. This file is very large and growing fast (20 GB at the end of 2011, 63 GB at the beginning of 2018) because it contains all the data for the entire planet. Extracts by continent, country or region are also available and updated daily by Geofabrik. There are also tools for breaking down a file into smaller geographical areas."
