msgid "Landslides are a major threat in most mountainous areas of the world, causing  nearly 10000 casualties every year. It has been observed that landslides can be preceded by a phase of acceleration, emphasising the interest in detecting slow ground-movements and monitoring their evolution through time. Knowing how the ground moves is essential to understanding the physical mechanisms controlling movement :cite:`lacroix2019`. Landslide displacement can be measured from space by two techniques: first, by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and then, by feature-tracking image correlation applied either to SAR or optical images :numref:`fig_surf_disp_optic_sar`."

msgid "On one hand, surface deformation obtained from InSAR is now being used to measure very small displacements (e.g., < 1 cm) and detect new unstable zones. Although this technique offers the possibility to map very large areas (up to 400 km for Sentinel-1), this kind of data has a complex data processing and encounters different limitations related with the unwrapping of the signal that makes it not fully adapted to small objects like landslides or fast objects like glaciers :cite:`garcia2024`. On the other hand, optical image correlation is an appropriate technique for monitoring large displacements or long-term displacements of small objects :cite:`cusicanqui2021_JGRES`. Although freely available data exist worldwide (Section 2), the main limitations for this data are the presence of snow at the surface, clouds and strong changes in contrast caused by shadows. These two techniques have become the main means of studying natural hazards that produce deformations of the earth's surface on different spatio-temporal scales :cite:`zhu2022`."

After the breaching of the dam, Colca river started to incise the soft clayey sediments and initiated landsliding in the whole area. Its historical activity can be traced back to the 1980's, when the Lari landslide pushed the river down to the Maca side, and started to erode the Maca side. Several large reactivation occurred in 1990's, 2000's, 2012-2013, and 2019-2020 :cite:`lacroix2019`, :cite:`zerathe2016`, :cite:`bontemps2018`.

msgid "Surface displacements from image correlation are obtained by tracking the translation of small, textured pixel windows between two accurately co-registered, orthorectified images acquired at different dates. A similarity metricâtypically normalized cross-correlationâyields sub-pixel offsets for each window; these offsets are converted to map-plane displacement vectors using pixel size. The method delivers dense 2-D horizontal motion fields (magnitude and direction), with uncertainty controlled by image texture, window size, co-registration accuracy, and radiometric changes :cite:`ayoub2008`. The main principle of image correlation is to divide the first image into small windows (or chips) and then search for the best matching window in the second image. However, modern softwares have implemented different strategies and algorithms to improve the accuracy, robustness and speed of the correlation process."

The process initially requires 2 images as main input data. However, there is several parameters that can be tuned to improve the quality of the results. For instance, the size of the correlation window (or kernel), the type of correlation algorithm (BM, Semi-Global Matching (SGM), etc), the refinement of the correlation function (subpixel-mode).
