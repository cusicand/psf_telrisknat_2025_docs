"Landslides are a major threat in most mountainous areas of the world, "
"causing  nearly 10000 casualties every year. It has been observed that "
"landslides can be preceded by a phase of acceleration, emphasising the "
"interest in detecting slow ground-movements and monitoring their "
"evolution through time. Knowing how the ground moves is essential to "
"understanding the physical mechanisms controlling movement "
":cite:`lacroix2019`. Landslide displacement can be measured from space by"
" two techniques: first, by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar "
"(InSAR) and then, by feature-tracking image correlation applied either to"
" SAR or optical images :numref:`fig_surf_disp_optic_sar`."

"On one hand, surface deformation obtained from InSAR is now being used to"
" measure very small displacements (e.g., < 1 cm) and detect new unstable "
"zones. Although this technique offers the possibility to map very large "
"areas (up to 400 km for Sentinel-1), this kind of data has a complex data"
" processing and encounters different limitations related with the "
"unwrapping of the signal that makes it not fully adapted to small objects"
" like landslides or fast objects like glaciers :cite:`garcia2024`. On the"
" other hand, optical image correlation is an appropriate technique for "
"monitoring large displacements or long-term displacements of small "
"objects :cite:`cusicanqui2021_JGRES`. Although freely available data "
"exist worldwide (Section 2), the main limitations for this data are the "
"presence of snow at the surface, clouds and strong changes in contrast "
"caused by shadows. These two techniques have become the main means of "
"studying natural hazards that produce deformations of the earth's surface"
