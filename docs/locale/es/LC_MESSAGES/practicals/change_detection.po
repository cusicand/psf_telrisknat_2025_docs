"We are now going to use `Open Street Map (OSM) "

"geographic database feed by a community of mappers that contribute and "
"maintain data about roads, trails. It is therefore possible to download "
"the raw data directly and reuse it as you wish, for cartographic or other"
" purposes. Every week, a complete file called ``planet`` is generated and"
" made available by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. This file is very large "
"and growing fast (20 GB at the end of 2011, 63 GB at the beginning of "
"2018) because it contains all the data for the entire planet. Extracts by"
" continent, country or region are also available and updated daily by "
"Geofabrik. There are also tools for breaking down a file into smaller "
"geographical areas."
